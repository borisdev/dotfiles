Here is synopsis of an alternative perspective on heart disease that contradicts what we learned growing up: Advanced Lipid Testing – Getting Closer to Personalized Medicine

Here are some takeaways

Key indicators

What needs to be tested (European guidelines)

- sdLDL-C (the most dangerous of the LDLs) 
- HDL2b (the best at clearing out LDL)

Inflammation Markers (ie. blood clot/stroke predictors)

- Fibrinogen – increased risk of clotting
- hsCRP – inflammation in blood vessel walls
- Myeloperoxidase – plaque inflammation and vulnerability
- LpPLA2 – plaque inflammation and vulnerability
